  <description>This mod made it so that purchase and sell price will be static and always equal to the market value stat of the item to be traded.
- Market price loss due to difficulty is ignored.
- Market price modifiers due to social skill levels and certain pawn traits are ignored.
- Item specific sell price multipliers are ignored.
- The hard-coded 50% sell price factor and 150% purchase price factor are removed.

You will still have to pay double the price for certain goods from certain orbital traders.

Incompatibility: None
Old Save Compatible: Yes
Safely Removable: Yes
